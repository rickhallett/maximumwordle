# Maximum Wordle: Node Edition

## TODO

### Reflections

1. Coding optimisitically (ie not YAGNI) was fun, felt like progress, but in many ways made it more difficult to develop the more complex algortihms later on. I hamstringed myself as much as helped myself
2. Its a wrestle to decide when a chain of operations can be wrapped in successive function calls, or if these should all be split out into named functions. When is too much, too much?
