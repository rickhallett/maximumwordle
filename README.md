# Maximum Wordle: Node Edition

## TODO

## Optimisations
1) Are there more efficient ways of finding multiple items within a list?
2) What is faster, `for` or `forEach`?
3) Is there a trade off between operating on a list of strings, or a list of objects representing those strings, that itself has helper methods on?

## Ideas
1) Handle all wordlist operations on array copies to prevent state mutation bugs
